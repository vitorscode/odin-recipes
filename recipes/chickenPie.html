    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken pie is a delicious dish made with a flaky crust and a filling of tender chicken pieces mixed with vegetables like carrots, peas, and potatoes. All of this is coated in a creamy sauce, making it a warm, comforting meal.</p>
    <p>This chicken pot pie recipe is a comforting and easy-to-make dish that starts with pre-cooked, shredded chicken mixed with a blend of frozen vegetables like peas, carrots, and corn.

    <p>Baking in the oven until the crust is golden brown, the pie emerges hot and fragrant, ready to be sliced and served. The result is a perfect balance of tender chicken, hearty vegetables, and a luscious, creamy sauce, all encased in a crispy, flaky crust. It's a straightforward recipe that delivers a satisfying and heartwarming meal for any night of the week.</p>
